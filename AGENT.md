This uses Maud for templating HTML with Rust. use p.class1.class2 { "Hello" } instead of p class="class1 class2" { "Hello" }. If it's a div with classes no need to include div, just .class1.class2 { "Hello" }. Whenever you see code that is not implemented like this, enforce this pattern of simplification.

Dont use playwright.
