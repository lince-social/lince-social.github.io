## Table: `views`

| views     | DATA STRUCTURE |
| --------- | -------------- |

| view_name | TEXT           |

We've spoken so much about views, let's dive into them. They are essentially SQL queries, allowing you to select what columns you want to see, filtered, ordered and much more, just the way you want it.
The view column has the SQL query, the view_name has the view's name. Simple, right?
