  Why should we insitute an Institute?

  Well... why not? We may receive donations, but maybe never. We can receive funding from technological development related government programs, but maybe never. We can build a legal body to take up the weight of the mundane and make the project more robust, but maybe we will feel it's weight all the same.

  Making the Lince Institute will actually give it more legitimacy, but maybe people will not care. It will cost two minimum wages from a short research, and maybe we could have saved the money to grow more. An Institute is like super cool, and maybe it actually is actually, periodt. Making an Institute represents pushing it forward, but does it really?

  Why shouldn't we institute an Institute?

  It seems that instituting an Institute would make everything just so much easier and fancy. Isn't that cool?

  How many resources should be directed into something so supportive like a legal organization for an open-source + non-profit + free as in free-lunch project ?

  The creation of an Institute means the destruction of underdogism. And the crazy, rabid, energetic underdogs win more often than we think. We can't loose that (except for the rabid part \#gettreated).

  According to game theory, not creating it might make those envolved work harder to make the project mainstream, making it's evolution a tough tiring grind, but with a more envolved team; keeping the underdog spirit to conquer the world. Or maybe it is an unproductive handicap and not that big of a deal.

  If making an institute makes the project be pulled by it's needs, we shouldn't do it. If it aims to complete the goal faster, better, if it pulls it's own weight and more, it's time to start thinking if the logo will be in the left, top or right side of the 'Instituto Lince' text.

  This was a pros and cons list, playing the devil's advocate and prossecutor. I wanted this to explain the: why not. Unfortunatelly, this time, the devil had a solid case. I convinced myself of the contrary and ended up thinking: why not?

  The Lince Institute is a contradiction, probably not the best idea, we keep it alive to kill it. The more we code and sustain it's growth, the less we Need it, the closer it is to it's end and to another start, the freshest start, with the freshest air, the freshest food and the freshest views.

    Like for the night tide pulling inward, we gift the world.

    Like as the morning tide pushing outward, we receive from the world.

    Like the horizon sun changing the tides, we keep the movement, with the Lince Institute.
